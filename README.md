# Anachro All in One Dev Card

Another crazy idea brought to you by @jamesmunns!

Join us at #anachro:matrix.org!

## Notes/Goals:

* Make a PCB that is "a whole anachro computer" on a tiny card
    * This makes it easier for people to develop on
    * I can ideally give some of these away to interested people
* Make sure we can build everything (except connectors) using JLCPCB
* Keep it as cheap as possible
